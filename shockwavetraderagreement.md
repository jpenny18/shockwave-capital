SHOCKWAVE CAPITAL FUNDED TRADER AGREEMENT

This Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into and made effective as of the date of the last signature by and between Shockwave Capital, a division of Ascendant Capital Investments LTD (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”), and [THE USER READING] (the “Trader”), in connection with the Trader’s successful completion of the Shockwave Capital Challenge and subsequent access to a Simulated Funded Account. For good and valuable consideration, the parties hereby agree to the following:

1. Right to Simulated Trading
   The Trader is granted a limited, non-transferable license to engage in simulated trading activity via a virtual demo account provided by the Company (the “Simulated Account”), which may reflect real-time financial market data from the foreign exchange (FOREX) or other financial markets. Access to the Simulated Account is conditional upon compliance with the terms of this Agreement and any associated Shockwave Capital programs, products, and policies. The Trader expressly acknowledges and agrees:
   The Simulated Account is wholly owned by the Company and does not represent access to real capital.

All performance in the Simulated Account is strictly for evaluation purposes.

Any potential remuneration, including simulated “payouts,” is entirely discretionary and subject to Company assessment of whether the Trader’s activity is aligned with realistic and acceptable trading behavior as determined solely by the Company.

The Trader’s activity within the Simulated Account must remain confidential. Disclosure or misuse of proprietary strategies, data, or account access will result in immediate termination of this Agreement under Section 15.

The Company may, at its sole discretion and without obligation, request the Trader to disclose the methodology or strategy used during trading. Refusal to cooperate may result in termination of this Agreement with immediate effect.

2. Capital and Risk Policy
   While the Company does not instruct or influence the Trader’s trading decisions or strategy, the Trader must adhere to predefined risk parameters. Specifically:
   The Trader’s Simulated Account equity (including open and closed positions, commissions, and swaps) must not fall below 85% of the original simulated starting balance at any time.

Violation of this rule will result in automatic closure of all open trades and revocation of account access without prior notice.

The Company retains the right to immediately terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 15 if this rule is breached.

3. Acknowledgements and Limitations
   The Trader acknowledges and agrees to the following:
   The Simulated Account does not involve real capital, and no actual profits, losses, or financial transactions occur.

The Company alone will determine whether the Trader’s simulated performance constitutes behavior that reasonably reflects trading in real financial markets.

The Company is under no obligation to issue any form of compensation, payment, or simulated payout unless it elects to do so, entirely at its discretion.

The Company may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including but not limited to breaches, suspicion of manipulation, or strategic concerns, as set forth in Section 15. 4. Right to Discretionary Remuneration
Subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the sole discretion of the Company, the Trader may be eligible for discretionary simulated remuneration based on the performance achieved within the Simulated Account. Any such payout is calculated based on net profits generated from closed trades, but only when the Company determines that trading activity closely reflects real-world market conditions.
Remuneration cycles are assessed on a rolling 30-day basis, beginning either from the Trader’s first day of trading or from the day following the most recent payout.

When eligible, the Trader may receive 90% of the net positive difference between the closing balance and the initial simulated capital in the funded account.

Payouts are not guaranteed. The Company retains absolute discretion to reject or modify the payout calculation or disbursement based on its internal assessment of trade legitimacy, realism, and strategy.

The Trader may only invoice the Company after receiving written confirmation of payout eligibility. Payment, when approved, shall be issued within 14 days of a valid invoice.

Shockwave Capital reserves the right to deny, withhold, adjust, or permanently cancel any and all remuneration without notice if trading behavior is deemed unrealistic, manipulative, or in violation of this Agreement.

5. Compliance with Terms, Broker Policies, and Trading Guidelines
   The Trader agrees not to engage in any form of trading behavior that:
   Violates the normal operation and logic of real-world financial markets,

Contravenes the rules and guidelines of the brokerage platform used,

Violates the Company’s current Terms, Risk Disclaimers, and Program Conditions as published at: https://shockwave-capital.com/disclaimer,

Breaches the trading limits or drawdown requirements set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement,

Conflicts with any binding legal or regulatory framework applicable under Cayman Islands jurisdiction.

Any violation of the above conditions will void the Trader’s eligibility for simulated remuneration, and the Company may immediately terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 15. 6. Legal Compliance
By signing this Agreement, the Trader agrees to adhere to all regulations applicable in the Cayman Islands or the jurisdiction in which the Company operates, including but not limited to trading restrictions, tax compliance, and financial reporting. The Trader is solely responsible for acquiring any permits or authorizations necessary to participate in simulated trading activities. 7. Conflicts of Interest
The Trader agrees to immediately disclose to the Company any personal or financial interests in activities that may present a conflict of interest with Shockwave Capital, including affiliations with competing firms or proprietary trading systems that may be in direct competition or conflict with the Company’s operations. 8. Confidentiality & Ownership of Work Product
The Trader shall maintain strict confidentiality over any and all proprietary information, technology, strategies, or internal processes shared or accessed during the course of this Agreement. The Trader shall not reproduce, trademark, patent, or claim ownership over any intellectual property or derivative work created during their time with Shockwave Capital unless expressly agreed to in writing by the Company. 9. Data Usage and Processing Consent
The Trader acknowledges and consents to the Company’s use of personal data for the following purposes:
Execution and administration of this Agreement;

Evaluation of trading performance and compliance across Shockwave Capital’s customer base;

Internal auditing, dispute resolution, and compliance reporting;

Integration with third-party systems and platforms used by the Company for account, analytics, or communication management.

All data processing is performed in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection regulations. By signing this Agreement, the Trader grants permission for their personal and trading data to be processed and stored accordingly.

9. Continued Consent for Data Processing
   The Trader grants Shockwave Capital consent to retain, process, and use their personal data throughout the term of this Agreement and for three (3) years following its termination, unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law. This includes use of personal data for:
   Execution and management of this Agreement;

Performance evaluations and account monitoring;

Compliance and dispute resolution procedures;

Notifications related to new services, products, or opportunities offered by Shockwave Capital or its affiliates.

The Trader acknowledges and agrees that if required by law or in cooperation with a law enforcement agency, the Company may retain personal data indefinitely without further notice or consent to aid investigative or regulatory activity. 10. Third-Party Data Sharing
The Company may disclose or transfer the Trader’s personal data to third parties, including technology partners, data processors, regulatory agencies, or foreign governments, only as necessary to:
Execute the terms of this Agreement;

Comply with applicable laws, regulations, and government requests;

Support systems or platforms necessary for account operation, billing, and compliance.

Unless prohibited by law, Shockwave Capital will notify the Trader of any such data disclosures. 11. Right to Access and Correction
The Trader retains the right to access their personal data and request corrections if any of the information held is inaccurate or being processed in violation of applicable data protection laws. Any such requests must be submitted in writing, and the Company will evaluate the request within a reasonable timeframe. 12. Return of Property
The Trader agrees to immediately return, upon request or upon termination of this Agreement, any Company-owned materials, content, data, internal documentation, software, strategy-related tools, or electronic devices related to Shockwave Capital. This includes all digital or physical copies, notes, and storage media. Copying, saving, or reproducing Company property in any form is strictly prohibited and may result in legal action. 13. Risk Management Violations
The Trader agrees to employ sound and reasonable risk management practices while trading on the Shockwave Capital Simulated Account. The following rules are strictly enforced:
Maximum Risk Exposure:
The total risk exposure from all open positions at any given time must not exceed 2% of the total simulated account balance. This means that traders must actively manage position sizing and account for real-world execution factors such as slippage, spread widening, gaps, liquidity, swaps, and commissions. If the combined impact of these factors causes the total loss on open trades to exceed the 2% limit, it will be treated as a breach of this rule. Any breach will trigger an immediate internal review of the trader’s account and may result in account termination or payout denial at the sole discretion of the risk team. To avoid unintended violations, traders are strongly advised to maintain a reasonable buffer below the 2% maximum risk threshold.

Profits exceeding 5% in a single trading day will trigger an account review. If such profit is deemed the result of reckless, unrealistic, or gambling-style trading behavior, the Company reserves the right to immediately terminate the Agreement and withhold all pending or future remuneration.

Violations of these conditions will be interpreted as speculative or abusive use of the platform, and the Company may exercise its right to termination as outlined in Section 15. 14. Binding Documents
The Trader confirms that they have read, understood, and agree to all of Shockwave Capital’s published legal terms, including the General Terms, Conditions, and Disclaimers (GTCD) and Privacy Policy, both of which are incorporated into and form an integral part of this Agreement. 15. Termination
This Agreement is entered into for an indefinite term. It may be terminated by either party at any time, without prior notice and with immediate effect, for any reason or no reason, at the sole discretion of the terminating party. The Company shall bear no obligation to provide justification or remuneration upon termination. 16. Duplicate Originals
This Agreement is executed in two original copies, each of which shall be deemed an equally valid and binding instrument. One copy shall be retained by Shockwave Capital, and the other by the Trader. 17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This Agreement, including all incorporated documents and appendices, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, where applicable, and subject to the local regulations of Alberta, Canada, where Shockwave Capital conducts operations.
In the event of any dispute that cannot be resolved through private mediation or arbitration as outlined in the Company’s General Terms and Conditions (GTCD), both parties agree that jurisdiction shall fall under the provincial courts located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and both parties expressly submit to this jurisdiction. 18. Amendments
No amendment, modification, waiver, or addition to this Agreement shall be valid or enforceable unless made in writing and signed by both parties. Verbal agreements or informal changes shall carry no legal effect. 19. Taxes and Financial Responsibility
The Trader acknowledges and agrees that Shockwave Capital shall bear no responsibility for the withholding, reporting, or remittance of any personal or corporate income taxes, fees, levies, or obligations related to any simulated earnings or remuneration paid under this Agreement. The Trader is solely responsible for complying with all tax obligations in their respective jurisdiction. 20. Independent Relationship
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a legal partnership, employment relationship, joint venture, or agency between the Trader and Shockwave Capital. The Trader participates in simulated trading as an independent participant and shall not be entitled to any employee benefits, legal protections, or rights unless explicitly stated in a separate, written agreement.
